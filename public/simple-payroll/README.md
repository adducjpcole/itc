# Simple Payroll

Write a Javascript Program to add and delete employees in a payroll list.

1. The payroll program should input the following:

    | Employee Name | Days Worked | Daily Rate | Deduction Amount |
    | :------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :--------------- |

2. During addition, the program should display the following in a table:

    | No.                      | Employee Name | Days Worked | Daily Rate | Gross Pay                       | Deduction Amount | Net Pay                         |
    | :----------------------- | :------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------ |
    | Payroll List Line Number |               |             |            | Days Worked $\times$ Daily Rate |                  | Gross Pay $-$ Deduction Amount` |

3. During deletion, the program should ask for the line number to delete then update the table.
