# Simple Payroll

Write a Javascript Program to add and delete employees in a payroll list.

1. The payroll program should input the following:

    | Employee Name | Days Worked | Daily Rate | Deduction Amount |
    | :------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :--------------- |
    | ...           | ...         | ...        | ...              |

2. During addition, the program should display the following in a table:

    | No. | Employee Name | Days Worked | Daily Rate | Gross Pay | Deduction Amount | Net Pay |
    | :-- | :------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :-------- | :--------------- | :------ |
    | ... | ...           | ...         | ...        | ...       | ...              | ...     |

    where:
    > No. = Payroll List Line number \
    > Gross Pay = Days Worked $\times$ Daily Rate \
    > Net Pay = Gross Pay $-$ Deduction Amount

3. During deletion, the program should ask for the line number to delete then update the table.
